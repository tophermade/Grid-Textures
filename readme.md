# Misc texture sizes

A (hopefully growing) collection of texture sizes. I use them for quickly prototyping concepts in Corona SDK but are probably useful for quite a few things.

* The grid I used to create grid.psd, used for the scene background and alignment, is from Orman Clarks "20 Seamless Photoshop Grid Patterns" - http://bit.ly/ej0xDy . It will need to be replaced as it's a 10px grid, but for now it suits my needs. 

* Textures are power of two, but not all are square. Grid is the exception, I design around 480*800 and 800*480 so those are the grid sizes
